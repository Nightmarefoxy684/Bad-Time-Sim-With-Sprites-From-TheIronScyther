# Bad-time-sim-but-with-sans-sprites-from-TheIronScyther-V1
This is a W.I.P bad time sim mod that replaces the sprites for sans with sans sprites redesigned by TheIronScyther.
Huge thanks to TheIronScyther on deviant art for the sprites for sans, go check him out!
Huge thanks to kayos156 for the bendy fight! I couldn't find out how to upload folders so I just forked his bendy fight and replaced all the files with the normal bad time simulator files plus two head changes in the sprite sheet so thank him for that!
I changed the sprites for the torso and legs and they didn't show up! I also finished the head sprite sheet but it's only showing one head the default sans head which shows the way i put it but wont show the rest of the head sprites i changed! So I am facing some difficulties finding out how to get those to load!!!
Edit: I got the sprites to load and all I did was change the repository name to have 'W.I.P' in the title and link so that suprised me that this was all I had to do to fix it! But whatever, it works now so I'm happy!
This is no longer a W.I.P, as of today, (9-24-19) version 1 (or V1) of this mod is now complete but there will be more work on it in Version 2 (V2), so this is officially Version 1 (or V1) of this mod complete! If anyone wants to help me with V2 once I start on it and put up some images that will be used in V2, just let me know and I will gladly let you help! But for now, V2 has not been made so you don't have to worry about it for now.
